# macOS Update


This script is used to update macOS devices within the period specified by the administrator.

The script offers the following advantages:

- The administrator does not need to schedule the updates.
- The script supports the current DDM methods.
- No hidden admin account is required.
- It is not necessary to enter a user password for performing the update.
- All texts that are displayed to the user in the dialog can be transferred via the configuration profile. No customization in the script necessary.
- The size of the window and the font size can be transferred via the configuration profile
